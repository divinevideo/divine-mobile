## Project Notes

## OpenVine Route Consolidation - Lifecycle Bug Fixed

Successfully fixed crash when scrolling hashtag feeds after route consolidation.

**Bug**: "Using 'ref' when a widget is about to or has been unmounted" errors
**Cause**: Route consolidation made GoRouter dispose widgets faster on param changes
**Fix**: Added `if (!mounted) return;` checks before using `ref` in async contexts

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/screens/hashtag_feed_screen.dart` - postFrameCallback + async safety
- `lib/screens/explore_screen.dart` - postFrameCallback safety

**Testing Required**:
Rabble needs to test hashtag navigation:
1. Go to hashtag feed (e.g., /hashtag/comedy)
2. Scroll through videos
3. Switch to different hashtag (e.g., /hashtag/lol)
4. Verify: No crashes, smooth transitions
