## Project Notes

OpenVine notifications refresh implementation completed at lib/screens/notifications_screen.dart:140 and lib/services/notification_service_enhanced.dart:651-673.

The refresh mechanism is simple: cancel all existing Nostr event subscriptions and re-subscribe to get fresh notifications. This works well with OpenVine's embedded relay architecture where subscriptions are lightweight.

Test coverage: test/screens/notifications_refresh_test.dart with 2 tests:
1. Verifies refreshNotifications() is called when user pulls to refresh
2. Verifies RefreshIndicator is present when there are notifications to display

Future enhancement possibility: Add visual feedback (toast/snackbar) when refresh completes with X new notifications.
