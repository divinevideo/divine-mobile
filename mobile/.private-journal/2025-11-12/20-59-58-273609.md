## Project Notes

**Completed Search UX Improvements**

Successfully implemented seamless automatic search with clean UX:

1. ✅ Automatic remote relay search (no button needed)
2. ✅ Removed "Search servers" banner and button
3. ✅ Removed "Found X more results from servers" banner
4. ✅ Removed spam logging ("✅ Added valid search result" x100)
5. ✅ Fixed video playback from search results via provider bridge

All changes maintain TDD compliance - tests written/updated for each change.
