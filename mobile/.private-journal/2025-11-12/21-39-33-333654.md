## Project Notes

**Search Navigation - Fixed Double Back Button**

Removed redundant overlay back button from search video player. AppShell already provides back button in AppBar that:
- Navigates from video → grid mode
- Preserves search term throughout
- Handles navigation to /explore when needed

Changes:
- Removed `onBackToGrid` parameter from ExploreVideoScreenPure
- Removed back button overlay UI (Stack with Positioned IconButton)
- Removed callback from SearchScreenPure

Tests: All 9 tests still passing after cleanup.
