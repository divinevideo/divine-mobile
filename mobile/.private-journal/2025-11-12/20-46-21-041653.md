## Project Notes

## Search UX - Removed Results Source Banner

**Change**: Removed "Found 100 more results from servers" green banner from search screen

**Rationale**: Users don't need to know about internal architecture (local vs remote). They just want to see all relevant results.

**What remains**:
- "Searching servers..." loading indicator (during search)
- Seamless result merging (local + remote combined)
- Total count in tab (e.g., "Videos (100)")

**What's gone**:
- "Found X more result(s) from servers" success banner
- Any mention of "local" vs "remote" results

All search tests still pass with updated expectations.
