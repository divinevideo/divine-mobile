## Project Notes

## Search UX Improvement - Auto Remote Search

**User request**: "it should immediately try and search on the relay when you search, and combine the results with the local as it arrives... and indicate as it loads that it's still getting results from the server, some loading indicator... we don't want the button to search servers user doesn't even know about local vs remote"

**Implementation location**: `mobile/lib/screens/pure/search_screen_pure.dart`

**Key change**: Line 168-169 in `_performSearch()` now calls `_searchExternalRelays()` automatically

**UX flow**:
1. User types search query
2. Local results appear instantly
3. "Searching servers..." indicator shows automatically
4. Remote results merge in as they arrive
5. Final count shows combined local + remote results

**Testing**: All tests in `test/screens/search_screen_hybrid_search_test.dart` pass

**No breaking changes**: Existing functionality preserved, just removed manual button requirement
