## Project Notes

**OpenVine Release Strategy**:
- Primary target platforms: **Android and iOS** (mobile-first)
- Secondary platforms: **Windows and macOS** (desktop apps)
- **NOT using Chrome/web release** - the divine.video website runs a separate React app
- The Flutter mobile codebase is specifically for native mobile and desktop apps
- When testing/debugging, we use Chrome for dev convenience, but production releases are native only

This affects decision-making around:
- Platform-specific optimizations (can focus on mobile/desktop, not web)
- Dependencies (can use packages that don't support web)
- Build scripts (prioritize native builds over web builds)
- Testing strategy (focus on real devices, not browser testing)
