## Project Notes

Critical bug: Hashtag search only works for locally cached videos. When searching for #music or any hashtag, if the videos aren't already in the embedded relay's SQLite cache, the query returns empty. This suggests the embedded relay isn't successfully proxying hashtag queries to external relays like relay3.openvine.co. Need to debug the hashtag subscription flow end-to-end.
