## Project Notes

## OpenVine Project Structure and Development Workflow

**Critical Architecture Understanding**:
- **Primary release targets**: iOS and Android mobile apps
- **Secondary targets**: Windows and macOS desktop apps
- **NOT for release**: Web/Chrome build - divine.video runs a SEPARATE React app
- **Primary development platform**: macOS desktop build (full features, fast iteration)

**Development Workflow**:
1. Develop and debug on macOS desktop first
2. Test on iOS simulator for mobile-specific features
3. Test on Android emulator for Android-specific features
4. Windows desktop is a secondary target

**Firebase Performance Monitoring**:
- Only works on iOS, Android, Windows, and macOS - NOT on web/Chrome
- iOS config already exists: `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist`
- Android needs `google-services.json` file from Firebase Console (package: `co.openvine.app`)
- Build configuration already updated to support Firebase on Android

**Relay Persistence Issue** (still unresolved):
- Relays added via UI are NOT persisted - only stored in memory
- Lost on app restart or hot reload
- Added comprehensive logging to make the issue visible
- Needs SharedPreferences or Hive integration to persist relay list

**Important Files**:
- `/android/settings.gradle.kts` - Contains Google Services plugin config
- `/android/app/build.gradle.kts` - Applies Google Services plugin
- `/android/app/google-services.json` - Firebase config (needs to be downloaded)
