## Project Notes

Hashtag feed has TWO cascading bugs:
1. Embedded relay doesn't forward hashtag queries to external relays (only checks local cache)
2. Even locally cached videos aren't displaying (16 videos found but 0 displayed)

This suggests either:
- Hashtag indexing is broken in the embedded relay
- getVideoEventsByHashtags() filtering logic has a bug
- The hashtag 't' tag isn't being stored properly when events are cached
