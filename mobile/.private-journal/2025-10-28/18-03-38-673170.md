## Project Notes

Hashtag search is completely broken due to flutter_embedded_nostr_relay bug. The relay finds videos with matching hashtags in its database but fails to emit them to the subscription stream. This is a package-level bug, not an OpenVine bug. Need to either:
1. File bug report with flutter_embedded_nostr_relay
2. Fork and fix the package
3. Implement workaround by bypassing embedded relay for hashtag queries
