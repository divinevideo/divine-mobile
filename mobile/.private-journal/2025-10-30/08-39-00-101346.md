## Project Notes

**Bug Report File Size Problem**

Current implementation has NIP-17 path for bug reports, but comprehensive logs can be 10MB+ (hundreds of thousands of lines across 10 rotating files).

**Existing alternatives in codebase**:
- `sendBugReportViaEmail()` - Creates file, shares via system dialog
- `exportLogsToFile()` - Exports all logs to file for sharing
- Both methods already implemented and working

**Firebase options available**:
- Firebase Cloud Storage - Already have firebase_core
- Firebase Crashlytics - Already integrated
- Could upload to Firebase Storage, send URL via NIP-17

**Blossom option**:
- Already using BlossomUploadService for videos
- Could reuse for diagnostic bundles
- Decentralized, user-controlled storage
