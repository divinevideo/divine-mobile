## Project Notes

**Bug Report Email Failure**

Rabble confirmed that `sendBugReportViaEmail()` isn't working in practice - users aren't completing the email send flow. This means we have NO working bug report system currently.

**Solution confirmed**: Upload file, send URL via DM
- Blossom upload is the obvious choice (already used for videos)
- Need to verify Blossom server can handle text files, not just videos
- Default server: https://blossom.divine.video

**Key question**: Where to upload the files?
- Blossom server (same as videos)
- Need to check if Blossom supports arbitrary file uploads or just media
- May need MIME type handling for text/plain files
