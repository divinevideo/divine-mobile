## Project Notes

**Bug Report Upload Fix - Complete**

**Problem**: NIP-17 messages couldn't handle multi-megabyte log files (users reported email method wasn't working).

**Solution Implemented**:
1. Upload full bug report to Blossom server (text/plain)
2. Send lightweight NIP-17 DM with URL to uploaded file
3. Automatic fallback to email if Blossom/NIP-17 fails

**Files Modified**:
- lib/services/blossom_upload_service.dart - Added uploadBugReport() method
- lib/services/bug_report_service.dart - Updated to use Blossom+NIP-17 flow

**Servers Available**:
- https://blossom.divine.video (default, user-controlled)
- https://blossom.nostr.build (backup option)
- https://nostrmedia.com (alternative)

**Next Steps for User**:
- Test the bug report flow end-to-end
- Verify Blossom server accepts text/plain uploads
- Consider adding UI progress indicator for upload
