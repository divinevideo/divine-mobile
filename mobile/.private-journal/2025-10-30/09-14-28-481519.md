## Project Notes

**Bug Report Integration Test Created**

File: `test/integration/bug_report_blossom_upload_test.dart`

**Test Coverage**:
1. Upload bug report to Blossom server
2. Verify file hash integrity
3. Test disabled Blossom handling
4. Test diagnostic collection
5. Test report size estimation

**Status**: Test file is complete and well-structured, but cannot run due to Flutter test binding initialization issue that affects ALL integration tests in the project (not just this one).

**Unit tests ARE passing**:
- 16/16 tests passing in `blossom_upload_service_test.dart`
- 10/10 tests passing in `bug_report_service_test.dart`

**Next step for Rabble**: Either fix the integration test framework issue project-wide, or manually test the bug report flow in the running app.
