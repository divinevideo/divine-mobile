## Project Notes

## Created Comprehensive CONTRIBUTING.md File

**Task Completed**: Created a proper contributors guide with build instructions and moved the Flutter Embedded Nostr Relay setup documentation from CLAUDE.md to CONTRIBUTING.md.

**What Was Done**:
1. Created new `CONTRIBUTING.md` file with:
   - Complete prerequisites (Flutter, Dart, Xcode, Android Studio, Node.js)
   - Initial setup instructions including embedded relay symlink setup
   - Platform-specific build instructions (macOS, iOS, Android, Windows)
   - Development workflow and testing guidelines
   - Code standards and TDD requirements
   - Pull request process
   - Common issues and troubleshooting

2. Updated `.claude/CLAUDE.md`:
   - Removed the detailed dependency setup section
   - Added pointer to CONTRIBUTING.md for detailed setup instructions
   - Kept the file focused on AI assistant instructions

3. Updated `README.md`:
   - Enhanced Contributing section with link to new CONTRIBUTING.md
   - Added quick start guide for contributors
   - Listed key topics covered in contributing guide

**Key Content in CONTRIBUTING.md**:
- **Embedded Relay Setup**: Generalized instructions (not using Rabble's specific paths)
- **Build Commands**: All platforms with both manual and script-based approaches
- **Development Workflow**: Hot reload, testing, code analysis
- **Code Standards**: Nostr ID handling, file headers, naming conventions, TDD principles
- **Testing**: Unit, widget, integration, and golden tests
- **Common Issues**: Troubleshooting guide for typical problems

**Files Modified**:
- Created: `/Users/rabble/code/andotherstuff/openvine/CONTRIBUTING.md`
- Modified: `/Users/rabble/code/andotherstuff/openvine/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (removed dependency section)
- Modified: `/Users/rabble/code/andotherstuff/openvine/README.md` (enhanced Contributing section)

**Architecture Note**: The embedded relay symlink setup is now properly documented for external contributors who won't have the same directory structure as Rabble's development environment.
