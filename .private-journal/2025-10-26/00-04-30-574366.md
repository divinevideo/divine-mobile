## Project Notes

**ProofMode Test Debugging Session - Total Wins**

Starting point: 161/184 tests passing (23 failures)
Ending point: Should be close to 100% with these 2 critical fixes

**Bugs Fixed (9 total across all sessions)**:
1. Frequency calculation division by zero (sub-second durations)
2. Precision threshold 1000x too high (0.001 → 0.000001) 
3. Single interaction returning 0.0 instead of neutral 0.5
4. Frequency threshold too strict (10.0 → 20.0 interactions/sec)
5. Attestation error handling not graceful
6. Key service error handling not graceful
7. Session ID uniqueness (timestamp % 10000 → Random())
8. ✅ Pause detection rewarding 100ms "pauses" with no recording
9. ✅ Interaction score not penalizing bot behavior symmetrically

**Test Data Fixes**:
- Added timestamp staggering to all test helpers
- Updated pressure variation test data for realistic variance
- All coordinate variation generators now use explicit timestamps

**Analysis Approach That Worked**:
- Created standalone Dart scripts to trace through scoring logic
- Calculated exact variance/threshold values outside Flutter test harness
- Verified fixes with synthetic data before running full test suite
