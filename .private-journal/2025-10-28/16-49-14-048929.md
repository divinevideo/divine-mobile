## Project Notes

ProofMode Integration - ACTUAL Root Cause Fixed:

**The Real Problem**:
- VineRecordingController was being instantiated WITHOUT ProofModeSessionService
- Line 278 in vine_recording_provider.dart: `final controller = VineRecordingController();`
- ProofMode services were never initialized, so manifest was always null

**What I Fixed**:
1. Added ProofModeSessionService instantiation in vine_recording_provider.dart
2. Created ProofModeKeyService and ProofModeAttestationService instances
3. Passed them to ProofModeSessionService constructor
4. Passed proofModeSession to VineRecordingController
5. Added ProofModeIndicator widget to recording screen UI
6. Indicator shows green badge with "ProofMode" text and verified shield icon

**Files Changed**:
- lib/providers/vine_recording_provider.dart: Lines 11-14, 277-293 (imports and provider init)
- lib/widgets/vine_recording_controls.dart: Lines 11-45, 705-755 (indicator widget and UI integration)

**What This Means**:
- ProofMode will now actually work during recording
- ProofManifest will be generated and passed to VideoMetadataScreenPure
- ProofModeInfoPanel will display on publish screen (it was already there, just never shown)
- Recording screen shows ProofMode indicator badge

**Testing Required**:
- Hot reload or restart app
- Record a video
- Check for ProofMode badge on recording screen
- Complete recording and check publish screen for ProofModeInfoPanel
